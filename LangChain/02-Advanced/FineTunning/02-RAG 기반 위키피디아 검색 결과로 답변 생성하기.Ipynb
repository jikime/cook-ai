Closed-ended questions are sometimes phrased as a statement which requires a response.\\nA closed-ended question contrasts with an open-ended question, which cannot easily be answered with specific information.\\n\\n\\n== Examples ==\\nExamples of closed-ended questions which may elicit a \"yes\" or \"no\" response include:\\n\\nWere you born in 2010?\\nIs Lyon the capital of France?\\nDid you steal the money?\\nSimilarly, variants of the above closed-ended questions which possess specific responses are:\\n\\nOn what day were you born? (\"Saturday.\")\\nWhat is the capital of France? (\"Paris.\")\\nWhere did you steal the money? (\"From the bank.\")\\nAt the same time, there are closed-ended questions which are sometimes impossible to answer correctly with a yes or no without confusion, for example: \"Have you stopped taking heroin?\" (if you never took it) or \"Who told you to take heroin?\"; see \"loaded question\".\\nA study by the University of Cincinnati found 20 to 40 percent of Americans will provide an opinion when they do not have one because of social pressure, using context clues to select an answer they believe will please the questioner. A classic example of this phenomenon was the 1947 study of the fictional Metallic Metals Act.\\n\\n\\n== Alternative formulations ==\\nThere are alternative names for the same concept. There is an entry in \"A Dictionary of Psychology - Oxford Reference\" for \"closed question\" for the concept described here. Statistics for search queries show \"closed question\" is coming more often than \"close ended question\" and \"closed-ended question\". Statistics from \"ngram\" show \"closed question\" is twice more frequent than \"closed-ended question\" in books.\\n\\n\\n== In education ==\\nSome in the field of education argue that closed-ended questions are broadly speaking \"bad\" questions. They are questions that are often asked to obtain a specific answer and are therefore good for testing knowledge. It is often argued that open-ended questions (i.e. questions that elicit more than a yes/no answers) are preferable because they open up discussion and enquiry.\\nPeter Worley argues that this is a false assumption. This is based on Worley\\'s central arguments that there are two different kinds of open and closed questions: grammatical and conceptual. He argues that educational practitioners should be aiming for questions that are \"grammatically closed, but conceptually open\". For example, in standard parlance, \"Is it ever right to lie?\" would be regarded as a closed question: it elicits a yes–no response. Significantly, however, it is conceptually open. Any initial yes–no answer to it can be \"opened up\" by the questioner (\"Why do you think that?\", \"Could there be an instance where that\\'s not the case?\"), inviting elaboration and enquiry.\\nThis grammatically closed but cognitively open style of questioning, Worley argues, \"gives [educators] the best of both worlds: the focus and specificity of a closed question (this, after all, is why teachers use them) and the inviting, elaborating character of an open question\". Closed questions, simply require \"opening up\" strategies to ensure that conceptually open questions can fulfil their educational potential.\\nWorley\\'s structural and semantic distinction between open and closed questions is integral to his pedagogical invention \"Open Questioning Mindset\" (OQM). OQM refers to the development, in educators, of an open attitude towards the process of learning and the questioning at the heart of that process. It is a mind-set that is applicable to all subject areas and all pedagogical environments. Teachers who develop an Open Questioning Mindset listen openly for the cognitive content of students\\' contributions and looks for ways to use what is given for learning opportunities, whether right, wrong, relevant or apparently irrelevant. OQM encourages a style of pedagogy that values genui'), Document(metadata={'title': 'France', 'summary': \"France, officially the French Republic, is a country located primarily in Western Europe.

For example, the \"relations between London and Washington\" refers to the \"relations between the United Kingdom and the United States\".\\n\\n\\n== Terminology and etymology ==\\n\\nThe word capital derives from the Latin word caput (genitive capitis), meaning \\'head\\', later borrowed from Medieval Latin capitālis (\\'of the head\\'). The Latin phrase Roma Caput Mundi meaning \\'Rome capital of the world\\' (lit.\\u2009\\'head of the world\\') was already used by the poet Ovid in 1st century BC. It originates out of a classical European understanding of the known world: Europe, North Africa, and Southwest Asia. The phrase is related to the enduring power of the city first as the capital of the Republic and the Empire, and later as the centre of the Catholic Church.\\nIn several English-speaking states, the terms county town and county seat are also used in lower administrative divisions. In some unitary states, subnational capitals may be known as \\'administrative centres\\'. The capital is often the largest city of its constituent, though not always.\\n\\n\\n== Origins ==\\n\\nHistorically, the major economic centre of a state or region has often become the focal point of political power, and became a capital through conquest or federation. Historical examples are ancient Babylon, ancient Athens, ancient Rome, Abbasid Baghdad, Constantinople, Chang\\'an, and ancient Cusco. The modern capital city has not always existed: in medieval Western Europe, an itinerant (wandering) government was common. \\nThe capital city attracts politically motivated people and those whose skills are needed for efficient administration of national or imperial governments, such as lawyers, political scientists, bankers, journalists, and public policy makers. Some of these cities are or were also religious centres, e.g. Constantinople (more than one religion), Rome/Vatican City (the Roman Catholic Church), Jerusalem (more than one religion), Babylon, Moscow (the Russian Orthodox Church), Belgrade (the Serbian Orthodox Church), Paris, and Beijing. In some countries, the capital has been changed for geopolitical reasons; Finland\\'s first city, Turku, which had served as the country\\'s capital since the Middle Ages under the Swedish rule, lost its position during the Grand Duchy of Finland in 1812, when Helsinki was made the current capital of Finland by the Russian Empire.\\nThe convergence of political and economic or cultural power is by no means universal. Traditional capitals may be economically eclipsed by provincial rivals as is the case with Nanjing by Shanghai, Quebec City by Montreal, and several US state capitals. The decline of a dynasty or culture could also mean the extinction of its capital city, as occurred at Babylon and Cahokia. \"Political nomadism\" was practiced in ancient Near East to increase ties between the ruler and the subjects.\\nAlthough many capitals are defined by constitution or legislation, many long-time capitals have no such legal designation, including Bern, Edinburgh, Lisbon, London, Paris, and Wellington. They are recognized as capitals as a matter of convention, and because all or almost all the country\\'s central political institutions, such as governmen')]\n",
